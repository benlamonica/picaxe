picaxe
======

All my picaxe related code from projects that I have done:

useless_machine.bas - code for a machine that turns off a button that was just turned on by the user. Uses switches, servos, interrupts and peizos.

police.bas - code for my pinewood derby car to control the LEDs on the top of the car.

sense.bas - code to control a sonar sensor
